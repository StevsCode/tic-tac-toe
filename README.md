# tic-tac-toe
I developed a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of a project. The game features an 
interactive gameboard stored as an array in a Gameboard object, with game flow controlled by an object. I 
utilized the module pattern for organizing code and ensuring minimal global variables. The game includes logic 
for detecting wins, ties, and player interactions, and displays results through the DOM. This project honed my 
skills in JavaScript, object-oriented programming, and DOM manipulation, as well as my ability to structure and 
organize code efficiently.
